<h1><ins>HomePage design of a simple Ecommerce Website SwipeCart</ins></h1>
<b>This is what my webpage looks like:-</b>
<p>Hello!!!In this project, I have designed the home page of an imaginary E-commerce website which I have named as "SwipeCart" using just HTML and CSS.One thing to be noted here is that in this project I have focussed on the designing aspect of the website only and it's 'look and feel' instead of the actual functioning. Another thing to be noted is that I have added dynamic images that dynamically keep changing every time the webpage is refreshed. I have added these images from https://unsplash.com/. Also another thing to be noted here is that even though I have tried to add a bit of responsiveness to my website, it is still recommended that it is opened and viewed on a P.C itself for a highly responsive experience. I really hope that you like this mini-project!!!</p>
